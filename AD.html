            <h1>How to access an on-premise Active Directory from cloud application using java</h1>
            <p>Recently I’ve spent lot of time to resolve one of the issues in accessing data from Active Directory. If
                you are trying to access data from Active Directory from your cloud application, then this blog is for
                you.</p>

            <p><b>ISSUE</b>
                <br/>In our project data from an on-premise Active Directory needed to be accessed from an application
                in cloud environment. So the application is in one private environment (Cloud) and Active Directory is
                in another private environment.</p>

            <p>The application has to go through http proxy server in the cloud environment to access Active Directory.
                LDAP protocol is used to access Active Directory and it needs ports 389 and 636 for simple and secured
                communication respectively. Unfortunately these ports are blocked in most of the corporate networks to
                keep their network secured from the internet.</p>

            <p>So if you have problem with any http proxy server blocking your calls, <b>"HTTP Tunneling"</b> is one of
                the solution to resolve it. Even though some ports(here 389 and 636) are blocked by proxy server, HTTP
                Tunneling method allows us to send/receive information to a destination server through the proxy server
                using the blocked ports.</p>

            <br/><b>HTTP tunneling is basically done in two ways</b>
            <br/><br/><b>1. HTTP CONNECT tunneling.</b>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>A variation of HTTP tunneling when behind an HTTP Proxy Server is to use the "CONNECT" HTTP method. In
                this mechanism, the client asks an HTTP Proxy server to forward the TCP connection to the desired
                destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the
                connection has been established by the server, the Proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and
                from the client. Note that only the initial connection request is HTTP - after that, the server simply
                proxies the established TCP connection. This mechanism is how a client behind an HTTP proxy can access
                websites using SSL (i.e. HTTPS).</p>

            <p>In simple terms initially a handshake has to be done between source and destination via proxy server
                using CONNECT method. Once handshake is done, a tunnel gets created between source and destination. Once
                the tunnel is created we can pass any information though that tunnel using any port. It means even
                LDAP/LDAPS requests can be sent through the proxy server.</p>

            <p>Note : Not all HTTP Proxy Servers support this feature, and even those that do, may limit the behaviour
                (for example only allowing connections to the default HTTPS port 443, or blocking traffic which doesn't
                appear to be SSL).</p>

            </br><b>2. HTTP without using CONNECT method</b>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>An HTTP tunnel can be implemented using only the usual HTTP methods as POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. In this
                proof-of-concept program , the server runs outside the protected network and acts as a special HTTP
                server. The client program is run on a computer inside the protected network. Whenever any network
                traffic is passed to the client, it repackages it as an HTTP request and relays it to the outside
                server, which extracts and executes the original network request for the client. The response to the
                request, sent to the server, is then repackaged as an HTTP response and relayed back to the client.
                Since all traffic is encapsulated inside normal GET and POST requests and responses, this approach works
                through most proxies and firewalls.</p>

            <p>Simply here all LDAP requests are wrapped into a HTTP request by tool one and passed through the proxy
                server and then another tool which is outside the protected network takes the HTTP requests from proxy
                server and extracts actual LDAP requests and send those requests to the destination(Active Directory).
                The same way response gets back to the application.</p>

            <p>Note : The second approach is just for information and I’ve not implemented this approach.</p>

            <p>Here is the typical JNDI code to connect Active Directory.</p>

            <pre>
        package com.ldap;

        import javax.naming.AuthenticationException;
        import javax.naming.Context;
        import javax.naming.NamingException;

        public class SimpleLDAPTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String username = "Administrator";
        String password = "oracle@123";
        String domain = "domainname.com";
        String userLogin = username+ '@' + domain; //username@domain
        String ldapURL = "ldap://ldap.example.com:389";

        // Setup environment for authenticating
        Hashtable<String, String> environment = new Hashtable<String, String>();
        environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
        environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, ldapURL);
        environment.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, "simple");
        environment.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, userLogin);
        environment.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);
        try
        {
        DirContext authContext = new InitialDirContext(environment);
        System.out.println("User is authenticated");
        }
        catch (AuthenticationException ex)
        {
        System.out.println("Authentication failed");
        }
        catch (NamingException ex)
        {
        ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        }
        }
        </pre>
            If you deploy the above code in a cloud environment, all the LDAP calls are blocked by the corporate http
            proxy server.

            <br/></br><b>How to modify the above code so that proxy server doesn't block LDAP calls.</b>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>JNDI uses default socket factory to connect to Active Directory. Also JNDI supports custom socket
                factory. So we can inject custom socket factory to JNDI code such that it uses the this socket factory
                to connect to Active Directory. We'll implement this socket factory such that it returns a tunnel socket
                whenever JNDI requests for a socket.</p>

            <p>Simply all we have to do is to create a tunnel socket between source and destination and do initial
                handshake between them. Here source is the cloud application and destination is on-premise active
                directory. Once the socket factory is implemented as described above, make sure to set JNDI property
                (java.naming.ldap.factory.socket) before creating DirectoryContext. Thats it now all the LDAP calls will
                go through proxy server even though proxy server blocks 389 port.</p>

            <pre>

            <br/><b>How to set socket factory to JNDI</b>

                first code patch (JNDI code to connect Active Directory.)</p>
            <pre>
        environment.put("java.naming.ldap.factory.socket", "com.activedirectory.factory.CustomSSLSocketFactory");
        </pre>

            <br/>
            <p><b>Add certificates</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are using self signed certificates for development purpose, you need to add those
                    certificates in jdk truststore. You can use IIS to create certificates in server where AD is
                    installed.
                    You can use keytool to import certificates in JDK trustore.
